#+title: L2s Readme

* Introduction
This repository contains a Python library for interacting with the ISN CRI project hosted at SDSC. More about this project can be found here [[a super cool link]] . This library allows a user to define a spiking neural network and execute it on one of two backends: the CRI neuromorphic hardware or if the hardware is not available a python simulation of the hardware.

* Installation
** Simple Installation
** Development Installation
- First install [[https://python-poetry.org/][Poetry]]
- Then clone this repository
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:3x10e8/L2S.git
#+END_SRC
- Next you will need to clone the cri-simulations repository into the same directory you just cloned this repository into
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:nishraptor/CRI_Simulations.git
#+END_SRC
- cd into the L2S repo you cloned and install the needed dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd L2S
poetry install
#+END_SRC
- finally activate the development environment
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
poetry shell
#+END_SRC
* Usage
** Running on the Simulator
*** Defining Network
*** Updating Synapse weight
*** Running a timestep
** Submitting Jobs to Run on the Hardware
The CRI hardware is hosted in the San Diego Supercomputting Center and jobs may be submitted to run on the hardware via the [[https://www.nsgportal.org/index.html][Neuroscience Gateway]
